    message: `Zubair makes things happen! 

    I had the pleasure of working with Zubair, a SW genius who is always reliable and responsive. I was always amazed by his ability to fix things in a matter of seconds when it was needed the most. I still remember one instance when I was in Angola on the last day of my project and some application functionalities where not working. I had 3 hours before my flight departs and as a last resort, I made a call to Dubai Office to get Zubair. Mr.Genius pulled the rabbit out of the hat and saved me from spending another day in Angola. :)
    During my 2 years with him, I never saw him missing any deadlines. He is easy going and at the same time very careful and cautious about his work.
    
    As a Software engineer or a leader, Zubair earns my highest recommendation. `,
